## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r, echo= FALSE}
setwd("C:/Users/Lucas/Downloads/Kuhnert+Venables-R_Course_Notes/Session1/Session1/")
source("FrontMatter.R")
```
Installing Packages.

```{R Cloud Data}
setwd("C:/Users/Lucas/Downloads/Kuhnert+Venables-R_Course_Notes/Session1/Session1/Datasets")
cloud <- read.table("cloud.txt", header=T)
cloud
```

Reading the cloud dataset.

```{R cloud Data 2}
attach(cloud)
x <- Ispc
y <- Cloudpt
n <- length(x)
```
Attached the data and set the variables under new "names". Then set n up.

```{r Cloud Data 3}
xmc <- x-mean(x)
X <- cbind(1,xmc,xmc^2,xmc^3)
X
```
Used the mean function for x and named it xmc. then used a cubic regression of y on x. The regression is now labeled under "X"

```{R Cloud Data 4}
XX <- t(X) %*% X  # the literalist way
XX <- crossprod(X) # more efficient alternative
Xy <- crossprod(X,y) # 2 argument form
b <- XX^-1 %*% Xy 
b
dim(XX)
dim(Xy)
```
Solved for b for the equation "b = (X'X)^-1 * X'y). 
First by setting "XX" by using t(X) %*% X, then trying it a simplier way by using the function crossprod. After that, set X'y by using the same crossprod function, but typing in (X,y) rather than just (X). Then set the equation up to solve for b.


```{R Cloud Data 5}
b <- XX^-1 %*% Xy
b
f <- X %*% b
f
r <- y-f
r
rr <- r^2
rr
ss <- (sum(rr))/(n-4)
ss
Vb <- ss*(XX^-1)
Vb
```
In this chunk, the previous chunk was used to solve for fitted values (f), residuals (r), the residual mean square (ss), and the variance matrix of the regression (Vb)

```{R Cloud Data 6}
se <- sqrt(diag(Vb))
ts <- b/se
```
In this chunk above, the square roots of the diaonal enteries of Vb were used to find the standard errors. Then, with the errors, t-stats were able to be calculated.

```{R Cloud Data 7}
R <- cbind(b,se,ts,1-pt(ts,n-3))
rnames <- c("Constant","Linear","Quadratic","Cubic")
cnames <- c("Coef", "Std. Err.", "t-stat","Tail prob.")
dimnames(R) <- list(rnames,cnames)
R
```
In this chunk, the results were rearranged and labeled.

```{R Cloud Data 8}
fm <- lm(y~1+xmc+I(xmc^2)+I(xmc^3))
summary(fm) # check the table
b-coef(fm) # check for numerical discrepancies
```
Lastly, here the calculations were checked for correction and numerical discrepancies.


```{R Longley Data}
require(stats); require(graphics)
attach(longley)
mns <-apply(longley,2,mean)
mns
vrs <- apply(longley,2,var)
vrs
```
The Longley data was attached and then the means and variances for the variables were identified. 

```{R Longley Data 2}
apply(longley,2,var)
var(longley)
```
Here, the results from above were compared using apply() and var().

```{R Longley Data 3}
cor(mns,vrs)
```
The correlation between the means and the variances were calculated. 

```{R Longely Data 4}
svd(mns)
svd(vrs)
Xc <- scale(longley[,7],scale=FALSE)
longley.x <- as.matrix(longley[,-7])
Xc <- resid(lm(longley.x~1))
xb <- apply(longley.x,2,mean) # calculate the 6 means
dm <-dim(longley.x)
Xc <- longley.x - matrix(xb,dm[1], dm[2],byrow=TRUE) # correct
```
In this chunk, The signular decinoisutuib of the mean matrix was determined. After that, the sample mean was subtracted from it from each of the columns of the matrix. Then, the dataset longley.x was created. Next, the residual function and then lm function were used on the newly created dataset -- this function set works more efficently than the scale function. After that, the 6 means were calculated and then checked for correctness.
