## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r Lab 1}

x <- 1:50
w <- 1+ x/2
rdata <- data.frame(x+x, y=1+2*x+rnorm(x)*w)

rdata
fm<- lm(y~x,data=rdata)
summary(fm)
attach(rdata)
search()
objects(2)
plot(x,y)
abline(1,2,lty=3)
abline(coef(fm),col="blue")
segments(x,fitted(fm),x,y,lty=4,col="red")
plot(fitted(fm),resid(fm),xlab = "Fitted values",ylab = "Residuals vs Fitted")
abline(h=0,lty=4)
qqnorm(resid(fm),main="Normal Scores Plot")
qqline(resid(fm))
detach("rdata")
rm(fm,x,rdata)
```

```{r}
require(MASS)
??Cars93
with(Cars93,plot(Type,Price, ylab="Price (in $1,000)"))
attach(Cars93)
Tf <- table(Type)
Tf
Cf <- table(Cylinders)
TC <- table(Type,Cylinders)
TC
Make[Cylinders=="5"]
rbind(cbind(TC,Tf),c(Cf,sum(Cf)))
plot(Weight,MPG.city)
```

In the chunk above, the data points were fit to a linear regression, where w "fanned out" any errors along the line. From there, a standard point plot was created, and a true regression line was formed. Since, the values are not exactly linear, some points (the residuals) were not included in the regression line. After all of that, a standard regression diagnostic plot was programmed to check unequal variances. Then from there, a normal scores plot was conducted, but since the previous points had unequal variances, this was not useful.

```{r}
Cars93T <- transform(Cars93,GPM=1/MPG.city)
with(Cars93T,plot(Weight,GPM, pch=3))
fm <- lm(GPM~Weight,Cars93T)
abline(fm,lty=4,col="blue")
plot(fitted(fm),resid(fm))
abline(h=0,lty=2)
identify(fitted(fm),resid(fm),Make)
```

In this chunk, the data frame Cars93 was used in which has the information of 93 makes of vehicles that were being sold in the Unites States in 1993. From this information, it was able to be programmed to determine how many cars and of what type are in the data, along with how many cylinders do the cars have, and a two way table to determine what cars were the only makes with 5 cylinders.

Then, weight and MPG (city) were plotted, but since it was not a straight line, MPG was changed to GPM, in which the plot looked more linear. From this new plot, a straight line was added to the curve to look at deviation. Once the fitted and residual fm were plotted, it was able to determine whether the cars had either a great or poor fuel economy (Positive Residual = Great Fuel Economy, Negative Residual = Poor Fuel Economy).

```{r}
x <-seq(-pi,pi,len=50)
y<- x
f <- outer(x,y,function(x,y)cos(y)/(1+x^2))
par(pty="s")
contour(x,y,f)
contour(x,y,f,nint=15,add=T)
fa <- (f-t(f))/2
contour(x,y,fa,nint=15)
persp(x,y,f)
image(x,y,f)
image(x,y,fa)
objects()
rm(x,y,f,fa)
```

This chunk allowed us to plot and contour 3 dimensional plots. Once the sequence was plotted, the region was set to square then contoured to add more lines for detail, and then transposed. once it was all programmed, R created the perspective images using (X,y,f) and its asymmetrical (x,y,fa).

```{r}
th <- seq(-pi,pi,len=200)
z <- exp(1i*th)
par(pty="s")
plot(z,type = "l")
w <- rnorm(1000)+rnorm(1000)*1i
w <- ifelse(abs(w)>1, 1/w,w)
plot(w,xlim=c(-1,1),ylim=c(-1,1),pch=4,xlab="",ylab="",axes=F)
lines(z)
w <- sqrt(runif(1000))*exp(2*pi*runif(1000)*1i)
plot(w,xlim=c(-1,1),ylim=c(-1,1),pch=1,xlab="",ylab="",axes=F)
lines(z)
rm(th,w,z)
```

The last chunk, introduced using R for complex arithmetic functions. In this case imaginary and real points were plotted together, then "random" numbers were plotted to fit inside the already plotted disc, but since it was not uniform, a second method was preformed so that the points were more uniform.
