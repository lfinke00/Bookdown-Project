# Subscripting

For objects with more than one elements, we use subscripting to access some elements.

## Numerical Subscripts

We use numerical subscripts to access the elements of a vector, 
array, or list.  The first element has subscript 1, the second 
has 2, and so on.  Subscript 0 is ignored (without warning).  
Negative subscripts indicate the ones to be left off -- 
extract all but the ones indicated with a negative sign.  
However, numerical subscripts must be all positive (including 0),
or all negative (including 0).  Mixing negative and positive 
subscripts will result in error.

We can use a sequence of integers expressed by `c()`, `seq()`,
and the colon operator.

## Character Subscripts

When an object is named, a character string or a vector of 
character string can be as subscript to extract the named 
element(s).  Negative character subscripts are not permitted.  
To exclude elements based on their names we use function `grep`.  
A call to any function that returns a character string (vector)
can be used as a subscript.

## Logical Subscripts

When using logical values (`TURE`, `FALSE`) to selectively access
elements of an object, we use a logical object with the same size 
of the object (or part of the object) that is being subscripted.
Elements corresponding to `TRUE` values in the logical object 
will be included, and elements corresponding to `FALSE` values 
will be excluded.

Logical subscripts are probably the most useful way to perform 
complicated tasks.  To understand the use of logical subscripts, 
we should take a look at the logic objects.  For example, suppose
we are interested in the subset of large values (> 10) of the following
object:

```{r}
 nums <- c(12, 9, 8, 14, 7, 16, 3, 2, 9)
```
A simple logical expression can be used to compare each of the elements
to the number 10:

```{r}
nums > 10
```
The logical operator `>` is vectorised -- applying a logical operator
to a vector will result in a vector of logical values.  

```{r}
length(nums)
length(nums > 10)
```

When using the resulting logical vector for subscripting, it will 
extract the elements for which the logical vector is true:

```{r}
nums[nums > 10]
```
Sometimes, we may want to known the indices of these elements.  
The function `which` accepts a logic vector and returns a 
vector containing the subscripts of the elements for which 
the logical vector was true:

```{r}
which(nums > 10)
```
This operation is equivalent to:

```{r}
seq(along=nums)[nums > 10]
```
 or
 
 ```{r}
 (1:length(nums))[nums>10]
 ```
 
Logical subscripts allow for modification of elements 
that meet a particular condition by using an appropriately 
subscripted object on the left-hand side of an assignment 
statement.  Suppose that values larger than 10 is impossible,
any observation with a value of above 10 should be removes 
(or replaced by `NA`), we can use the logical subscripts:

```{r}
nums[nums > 10] <- NA
nums
```

## Subscripting Matrices
When an object has more than 1 dimensions, subscripts can 
be provided for each dimension separated by a comma (or commas).
For a multidimensional object, empty subscript on one dimension
means that all elements of that dimension will be extracted.
For example, while `x[3,4]` extracts the element in 3rd 
row and 4th column, `x[3,]` extracts the entire 3rd row.

```{r}
x <- matrix(1:12, 3, 4)
x
x[3,4]
x[3,]
x[,c(4, 1)]
```
When a matrix is subscripted with a single subscript, the matrix
is treated (silently) as a vector composed of all the columns of 
the matrix.  This may be useful in certain situations, but can be
confusing.

```{r}
x[10]<-NA

```

Here is an example where a single script is convenient. In missing
value problems, we often want to impute missing values, either missing
at random or values are known to be less than certain threshold 
(e.g., method reporting limit).  Numerically, these missing
values are treated as unknown quantities to be estimated.
Almost all numerical algorithms require a set of starting (or
initial) values.  I wrote a function to supply such initial values:

```{r}
ini <- function (x, inival){
  nas <- is.na(x)
  x[nas] <- inival
  x[!nas] <- NA
  return(x)
}
```
This function can take both vectors and matrices as `x`.

```{r}
x[10] <- NA
ini(x, 0)

y <- 1:12
y[10] <- NA

ini(y, 0.5)
```

Sorting a matrix by a particular row or column is most conveniently 
done through subscripting.  Let's use the data `stack.x` as an example.  
The object includes operational data of a plant that makes nitric acid 
by oxidation of ammonia. It is a matrix of three columns 
(`"Air.Flow","Water.Temp","Acid.Conc"`).  We can sort the matrix by
the column `Air.Flow`:

```{r}
stack.x.sorted <- stack.x[order(stack.x[,"Air.Flow"]), ]
head(stack.x.sorted)
```

A note on `ordered`:

```{r}
temp <- rnorm(10)
temp
order(temp)
```

Now we have sorted the data frame by `Air.Flow`.  What if you 
want to sort it first by `Air.Flow`, then by `Water.Temp` and 
then by `Acid.Conc.`?

```{r}
stack.x.sorted <- 
  stack.x[order(stack.x[,1], stack.x[,2], stack.x[,3]), ]
```

Let's look at a data frame.  The famous iris data was used by Fisher 
and Anderson to illustrate ANOVA.  The data set consists of measurements
in centimeters of the variables sepal length and width and petal length
and width for 50 flowers from each of three species of iris.  The 
species are *iris setosa, versicolor* and *virginica*.  We can sort the
data frame by columns, and use the function `do.call` to pass the 
column names:

```{r}
sortframe <- function(df, ...) df[do.call(order, list(...)),]

with(iris, 
sortframe(iris, Sepal.Width, Sepal.Length, Petal.Width, Petal.Length))
```

The use of `order` results in ascending order.  We may want to sort in 
descending order. The order can be reversed by using `rev()`:

```{r}
stack.x.sorted <- stack.x[rev(order(stack.x[,"Air.Flow"])), ]
head(stack.x.sorted)
```

We can rewrite the function `sortframe` to sort in descending order:
```{r}
sortframeD <- function(df, ...) df[rev(do.call(order, list(...))), ]
iris.sorted <- with(iris, 
sortframeD(iris, Sepal.Width, Sepal.Length, Petal.Width, Petal.Length))
```

## `drop=FALSE`

When extracting one row or one column from a matrix, the resulting 
object becomes a vector (reduced dimension by 1).  In some cases
we want to maintain the original data structure (keep a matrix a matrix).  
```{r}
stack.x[1,]
stack.x[1,,drop=FALSE]
```
When applied to a data frame, extracting a column may result in losing the name. Using `drop=FALSE` allows to keep the name:
```
iris[,2,drop=FALSE]
```

Using subscripts, it is easy to selectively access any combination of rows and/or columns that you need.  For example, we can select all the columns of the matrix `x` for which the first column is larger than 1:
```{r}
x[,1] > 1
x[x[,1]>1, ]
```

In a data frame, we can extract rows representing a specific site, date, or species:
```{r}
setosa <- iris[iris$Species == "setosa", 1:4]
```

# Two Useful Functions for Matrix

The functions `row` and `col` can be used to help subscripting
matrices.  By themselves, the functions are not very useful.  
They are very helpful in handling squared matrices when carrying
out matrix operations.

```{r}
col(x)
row(x)
```
For a squared matrix:
```{r}
z <- matrix(1:16, 4, 4)
rw <- row(z)
cl <- col(z)

offd <- rw != cl
```
We now have off-diagonal and diagonal elements:
```{r}
z[offd]
z[!offd]
```

# List

List is the most general way to store  a collection of objects in R.  There is no limitation on the mode and size of the objects.  An unstated rule of sub-scripting is that the returned object is of the same mode as the object being sub-scripted.  It is natural for vectors and matrix. But for a list, each part of the list can be of different mode.  For example, 
```{r}
list.example <- list (a = c('fred','sam','harry'), b=rnorm(10))
mode(list.example)
list.example[2]

mode(list.example[2])
```
Although the second element of the list is numeric, R 
took it as `list`:

```{r}
mean(list.example[2])
```
That is, the result is a list of one element.

R provides two ways to resolve this issue.  First, if the elements of a list are named, the actual elements can be accessed by separating the name of the list and the name of the element with a dollar sign (\$):
```{r}
mean(list.example$b)
```
When using the dollar sign is inappropriate (e.g., unnamed elements), R allows us to use the double bracket subscript operator.  The double bracket operator will extract the actual list element:
```{r}
mean(list.example[[2]])
mean(list.example[["b"]])
```
When using a list, single bracket will return a list, double bracket will return an object with the mode of the extracted element.

```{r}
list.example[1]
list.example[[1]]
```
It is fine to use `list.example[1:2]`, or `list.example["a","b"]`, but `list.example[[1:2]]` will return something unexpected.

# Aggregation
R has many functions for data aggregation.  For simple tabulation and cross-tabulation, the function `table` is adequate.

For more complex tasks, there are two groups of functions. For array data (vectors, matrices, arrays), we can use `apply, sweep, mapply, sapply`, and `lapply`.  For data frame, we use `aggregate`, `by` (which is a wrapper for `tapply`).

## Tabulation

When the function `table` is used on a vector, it returns a named vector of counts of unique values in the vector:
```{r}
pets <- c('gold fish', 'dog','cat', 'duck', 'gold fish', 'chicken','duck','cat','dog')
tbl <- table(pets)
tbl
```
The output can be converted into a data frame:
```{r}
as.data.frame(tbl)
```

When `table` is applied to multiple vectors, it will return a cross-tabulation. For example, a two vector situation:
```{r}
hiinc <- state.x77[,'Income'] > median(state.x77[,'Income'])
stateinc <- table(state.region, hiinc)
stateinc
as.data.frame(stateinc)
```

When we pass a data frame to `table`, it treats each column as a separate variable:
```{r}
x <- data.frame(a=c(1,2,2,1,2,2,1),
                b=c(1,2,2,1,1,2,1),
                c=c(1,1,2,1,2,2,1))
x
table(x)
as.data.frame(table(x))
```
The data frame output is especially useful in analyzing data with multiple factors.  The data frame output summarizes the frequency of each unique combination.

With a two way cross-tabulation, we can also add margins of summary statistics.  Let's use the data `infert`.
```{r}
temp <- table(infert$education, infert$parity)
temp
```
To add a row of margins:
```{r}
temp1 <- addmargins(temp, 1)
```
The default summary statistics is `sum`.  To change the statistics:
```{r}
temp2 <- addmargins(temp, 1, FUN=mean)
```
To add a column of margins:
```{r}
temp3 <- addmargins(temp, 2)
```
To add both column and row of margins:
```{r}
temp4 <- addmargins(temp, c(1,2))
```

Some times, we are interested in having a table of proportions instead of counts.  We can use the function `sweep`or `prop.table`, which accepts a table and a margin:
```{r}
prop.table(temp,2)
```

Similar to `table`, `xtabs` also produces cross-tabulations but uses formula:
```{r}
xtabs(~state.region+ hiinc)
```
If a variable is given on the left-hand side of the tilde ($\sim$), it is interpreted as a vector of counts corresponding to the values of the variables on the right-hand side, making it very convenient to convert tabulated data into a table:
```{r}
x
dfx <- as.data.frame(table(x))
xtabs(Freq~a+b+c, data=dfx)
```

## General Considerations of Aggregation

- How are the groups that divide the data are defined? (list, column/row of a matrix, one or more variables of a data frame)
- What is the nature of the data to be operated on?
- What is the desired end result?

*Groups defined by a list element.* We use `sapply` or `lapply`.  `lapply` always returns a list, `sapply` may simplify its output into vectors or matrix when appropriate.

*Groups defined by a row or column of a matrix.* `apply` should be used.`apply` returns a vector or matrix (array).

*Groups defined by one or more grouping variables.* Which function to use depends on what outcome do you want.

If we are interested in calculating scalar statistics (e.g., mean, variance), we often use `aggregate` because it returns a data frame.  If the result is a vector, `tapply` is often used.  

### `sapply`
We use the data `ChickWeight` as an example.
```{r}
?ChickWeight
names(ChickWeight)
sapply(ChickWeight, class)
```
Here, we have a data frame (a list) of 4 elements.  Using `sapply`, we apply the same function (`class`) to each of the element.  

### `apply`
The function `apply` is used for aggregating a matrix by row or by column.  It can be used more generally for an array (more than two dimensions).  

```{r}
apply(state.x77, 2, sum)
```

When the function returns more than one scalar value, the output will be a matrix:
```{r}
apply(state.x77, 2, summary)
```

We can provide functions for calculating specific statistics:
```{r}
sumfun<- function(x) 
  c(n=sum(!is.na(x)), mean=mean(x, na.rm=T), sd=sd(x, na.rm=T))
apply(state.x77, 2, sumfun)
```
The function we wrote takes a vector (`x`) as input.  If a function takes additional input variables (e.g., the function `mean` has additional arguments such as `na.rm`), these additional inputs are entered after the function argument.
```{r}
apply(state.x77, 2, mean, na.rm=T, trim=0.25)
```

Additional uses:
```{r}
maxes <- apply(state.x77, 2, max)
sweep(state.x77, 2, maxes, "/")
```

Suppose that we are interested in calculating the mean for each variable in `state.x77`, using only those values which are larger than the median for that variable.  

```{r}
meds <- apply(state.x77, 2, median)
meanmed <- function(x, med) return(mean(x[x>med]))
meanmed(state.x77[,2], meds[2])
```
When using `apply`, we apply a function to multiple variables.  If there are additional arguments (e.g., `na.rm=T` in `mean`), the additional arguments are the same to all variables.  In this function, we also apply one function to several variables, but the additional argument (`meds`) has different values for different variables.  In situations like this, we use `mapply`.  Because `mapply` is written for list, the matrix `state.x77` must be converted into a data frame:
```{r}
mapply(meanmed, as.data.frame(state.x77), meds)
```

### Mapping a Function Based on Groups

Frequently, groups are defined by multiple variables (e.g., see `ChickWeight` and `iris`).  If we are interested in calculating a scalar summary statistics, we can use `aggregate`
```{r}
aggregate(iris[-5], iris[5], mean)
aggregate(ChickWeight$weight, ChickWeight[c('Time','Diet')], mean)
```
(Read `?aggregate` and find out why `aggregate(iris[,-5], iris[,5], mean)` won't work.)

(Note the difference in output format.)

When groups are defined by one vector, we use `tapply`.
```{r}
sepalL <- tapply(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Species, mean)
sepalL.range <- tapply(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Species,range)
```
The object `sepalL.range` is a list of three elements.  It is often convenient to convert it to a data frame:
```{r}
sepalL.range<-data.frame(group=dimnames(sepalL.range)[[1]], 
                         matrix(unlist(sepalL.range), ncol=2, byrow=T))
```

We can also use `tapply` with more than one grouping varaibles, just as `aggregate`.
```{r}
iris2 <- data.frame(value = unlist(iris[,-5]), 
                    Species = rep(iris$Species, dim(iris)[2] -1),
                    Variable = rep(names(iris)[-5], each=dim(iris)[1]))

iris.range <- tapply(iris2$value, iris2[c('Species','Variable')], range)
iris.range
iris.range[['setosa', 'Petal.Length']]
```
To make it useful, we convert it to a data frame:
```{r}
iris.range.df <- data.frame(expand.grid(dimnames(iris.range)),
                            matrix(unlist(iris.range), byrow=T, ncol=2))
```

In many cases, we want to subtract group means from the data.  For example, the data set `CO2` consists of results from an experiment for studying cold tolerance of two types of grass under two levels of temperature treatment.  The objective is to learn about CO$_2$ uptake by the plants at various ambient concentrations.  It is a nonlinear regression problem.  There were 12 plants in the experiment. The plot below shows the response of each plant.

```{r}
coplot(uptake ~ conc | Plant, data = CO2, show.given = F, type = "b")
```

We are interested in the effect of temperature treatment and grass type on the CO$_2$ uptake process.  In a regression problem, it is often necessary to ``center'' the data, that is, subtracting the mean or median of each treatment-type combination from the data.  We can calculate the means using `tapply`:

```{r}
mns <- tapply(CO2$uptake, CO2[c('Type', 'Treatment')], mean)
mns
```
Now the questions is how do we subtract these means from their respective uptake data.  When using `tapply`, we provide a function.  If calling `tapply` without a function, a vector of indeces will be returned:

```{r}
inds <- tapply(CO2$uptake, CO2[c('Type', 'Treatment')])
inds
```
These indices can be used as a subscript:
```{r}
mns[inds]
```
which returns the calculated means for each type-treatment combination.  Now the centering is as simple as:

```{r}
adj.uptake <- CO2$uptake - mns[inds]
adj.uptake
```

```{r}
coplot(adj.uptake ~ conc | Plant, data = CO2, show.given = F, type = "b")
```
