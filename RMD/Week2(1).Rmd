# Front Matters

This is a RMarkdown document on R data objects for September 7.

An advantage of using R is the large selection of R packages, which greatly increases R's functionality.  A package must be installed and then loaded for the contents to be available.  To load a package we use R function `require`.  To install a package we use `install.packages`.  I wrote a function to automatically (1) check whether a package is installed, (2) (if not) install it, and (3) load it:

```{r, prompt=TRUE}
## load/install packages
packages<-function(x, repos="https://cran.r-project.org", ...){
  x<-as.character(match.call()[[2]])
  if (!require(x,character.only=TRUE)){
    install.packages(pkgs=x, repos=repos, ...)
    require(x,character.only=TRUE)
  }
}
```

We will keep this function at the beginning of an R script file, and use it when we need to load a package.  With this function, we can install packages when we needed.

The R working directory is where R will read and save data.  I use the following lines to set a working directory:

```{r}
base <- "C:/Users/sqian/OneDrive - University of Toledo/teaching/DataManagement/Fall2022/R"
dataDIR <- paste(base, "Data", sep="/")
## put your data set in the Data sub-directory
plotDIR <- paste(base, "Figs", sep="/")
## put created figures in the Figures sub-directory
setwd(base) ## not necessary
```
The most direct way to set the working is to open the Rmd file from the finder/file explorer by clicking on the file name. RStudio will automatically select the directory (where your .Rmd file is) as the working directory.  In that case, you should use `base <- getwd()`

To load packages, we use the function `packages`:
```{r, include=FALSE}
packages(UsingR)
packages(rpart)
packages(lattice)
packages(arm)
packages(maptools)
packages(maps)
packages(mapproj)
packages(readxl)
## packages(tikzDevice)

temp <- read_excel(paste(dataDIR, "2018 WBE 1.xlsx", sep="/"),
                   col_names=F)

```

# Importing Data into R

## Typing Vectors and Matrices

We used function `c` for entering small data into R. If we have a lot to type in, the function `scan` is more appropriate when data are in the same mode.  We specify the mode by using argument `what=`.  The default mode for `scan` is numeric.  

```
	x <- scan()
	1 3 1 3.2	
	
```
We can change the default to read in character values:

```
  name <- scan(what="")
  joe fred bob john
  sam sue mary ann

```
To enter data with different modes

```
pets <- scan(what=list(a=0, b="", c=0))
1 dog 3
2 cat 4
3 duck 8

```

We can enter a matrix:

```
x <- matrix(scan(), ncol=3)
19 30 22
2 5 1
9 3 0
11 34 56

```

## Reading Data Frame

The most useful function for importing data to R is `read.table`.  It returns a data frame, suitable for reading data files with mixed modes.  When we have a single mode data file, `scan` is more efficient.  `read.table` expects each field in the input source to be separated by one or more separators (default: any of spaces, tabs, newlines or returns).  The `sep=` argument can be used to specify alternative separators.  When there is no separator in the input data, but each variable occupies the same columns for every observation, we use `read.fwf` function.

If the first line in your input data has variable names separated by the same separator as the data, the `heder=T` argument should be passed to `read.table` to use these names to identify columns. Alternatively, the `col.names=` argument can specify a character vector containing the variable names.

The only required argument to `read.table` is a file name, URL, or connection object.  In Windows, make sure that **double back-slashes** are used in path names.  Alternatively, we can use the Unix convention, single forward slash, for path names.  You can also mix double
backslashes and single forward slash:

```
my.data <- read.table("c:/myclass\\subject1\\notes/data\\mydata.txt")
```

Because it offers increased efficiency in storage, `read.table` automatically converts character variables to factors (check if it is still true: `default.stringsAsFactors()`).  This may cause some problem when trying to use the variable.  We can either change the global option `options(stringsAsFactors=FALSE)`, or convert factors back to characters when needed.

Any text after a `#` sign is treated as comment (not read into R).  If the source use a different character for comments (e.g., `*`), we can use the `comment.char=` argument.  If there are no comments, setting `comment.char=""` may speed up reading.

The arguments `skip` and `nrows` allow us to skip a number of lines at the beginning of the file and read into R only a specific number of lines.

`read.table` expects the same number of fields on each line and will return an error if it detects otherwise.  When `read.table` reports unequal number of fields, we can use the `count.fields` function to help determine where the problem is.

Most of data files use comma or tab as separator.  R functions `read.csv`, `read.csv2`, and `read.delim` are wrappers for `read.table` with appropriate arguments set for comma-, semicolon-, or tab-delimited data, respectively.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
finnish <- read.csv(paste(dataDIR, "summerAll.csv", sep="/"), header=T)
neuseEstuary <- read.csv(paste(dataDIR, "estuary.csv", sep="/"), header=T)
antarctic <- read.csv(paste(dataDIR, "antarctic.csv", sep="/"), header=T)

head(finnish)
head(neuseEstuary)
head(antarctic)
```

## Fixed-with Input Files

Many government agencies store data using fixed-width file -- input data is stored with no delimiters between values but with each variable occupying the same columns on each line of input.  The function `read.fwf` can be used for such files.  For an example of such files, we can go to [USGS Water Quality site](http://pubs.usgs.gov/dds/wqn96cd/). Stream flow and water quality data are stored under the ``Water Quality and Streamflow Data'' tab. 33 As an example, we download nutrient data from Maumee River (Waterville station) and the format file for water quality data. The format file from the USGS site describes the format of the file.  All files starts with basic information on sites and data collection:

```
Columns  Format  Contents

  1-8     I8     Station number - the 8 digit station number uniquely identifying the station.
  9-12    I4     Sample collection beginning year 
 13-14    I2     Sample collection beginning month

To use `read.fwf`, we need to specify `widths=` with a vector of the widths of the fields to be read, using negative numbers to indicate columns to be skipped.  Because variable names are also specified in the format file, we will use `header=FALSE` and `col.names=` to give variable names.  The downloaded file is large. To avoid typing errors, I will copy and past the format file to extract the needed values -- deleting text before the format and comment out text after the format number:

The above code should be kept, in case we have typed something wrong.  With `colW` and `colN`, we can now read the file into R:

```{r Maumee}
Maumee.data <- read.fwf(file="https://pubs.usgs.gov/dds/wqn96cd/wqn/wq/region04/04193500.nut", 
                        widths=colW, col.names=colN,
                        header=F)
head(Maumee.data)
save(Maumee.data, file = "maumee.RData")
```

## Generating Data

From time to time, we need to create data in R.  R has a number of ways to generate vectors of data.

### Sequences

To generate a sequence of integers between two values, the colon operator (`:`) can be used:
```{r}
1:12
```

To create a vector of value from 10 to 100, each element separated by 5, we use:
```{r}
seq(from = 10, to = 100, by = 5)
```
Alternatively, we can specify the length of the generated sequence:
```{r}
seq(from = 10, by = 5, length = 10)
```
We can also general a sequence of values evenly spaced between two values
```{r}
seq(from=1, to=10, length=20)
```

Two functions frequently used in generating levels of a designed
experiment.  One is `gl` (short for generate levels):

```{r}
gl(4, 3, 24) ## 4 levels, each with 3 replicates, and length 24
thelevels <- data.frame(group=gl(3, 10, length=30),
                        subgroup=gl(5, 2, length=30),
                        obs = gl(2, 1, length=30))
thelevels
```

The other function is `expand.grid`, which takes a number of sequences and returns a data frame with one row for each unique combinations of input values:
```{r}
oe <- expand.grid(odd=seq(1,5, by=2), even=seq(2,5, by=2))
oe
```
This function is especially useful for generating data for plotting 3D plots (contour and perspective plot).

## Random Number Generators

R provides random number generators for about 20 probability distributions.  Names of functions for these generators start with letter `r` followed by the abbreviation of the distribution.  For example `rnorm` is a generator for the normal distribution.  These functions take `n=` as the first argument (number of random numbers to be generated) and other arguments are based on different
distributions.
```{r}
rnorm(10)
```

## Random Permutation

The function `sample` is a flexible function for random permutation of a vector (when the first argument is a vector) or of the index starting from 1 (when the first argument is a single integer).
```{r}
sample(10, 3)
sample(10)
```

## Spreadsheet

The package `gdata` has a function `read.xls` that can be used to read Excel spreadsheet files.  The function requires `perl`, which is installed in OS X, Unix, and Linux, but not necessarily on Windows. `read.xls` translate a specified spreadsheet to a comma-separated file, then calls `read.csv` to read the file into R.

# Saving R Data

Each time when an R session ends, R will prompt you to save the `Workspace` (all data imported and processed) into a file named `.RData` in the working directory.  The saved data will be loaded automatically when R starts the next time.

Most of the time, we don't need to save the entire work space, but only a few selected files.  For example, we can save file `x, y, z` using function `save`:

```
save(x,y,z, file="myxyz.RData")
```

Once the data is saved, it can be loaded with function `load`:

```
load("myxyz.RData")
```

## Writing R Objects to Files in ASCII Format 

In many cases, we want to save data into text files.  In R, we use `write`.  It accepts an R object and the name of a file, and writes an ASCII representation of the object into the appropriate destination.  In most cases, we save numeric objects such as matrices.  When writing data into a text file, the file is filled by row.  The number of values to be written in a line is specified by the argument `ncolumns=`.  Because R stores a matrix by column, R will export the matrix in that order.  That is, the first column of a matrix will be saved to fill the first row in the output file.  If we want to save a matrix by row, we need to first transpose the matrix and specify `ncolumns=` accordingly.

```
write(t(state.x77), file="state.txt", ncolmns=ncol(state.x77))
```

For mixed mode data, like data frames, we use `write.table` to produce ASCII files.  The first argument of the function is the data object and the second argument is `file=`, the destination.  By default, character strings are surrounded by quotes.  this feature can be suppressed by using argument `quote=FALSE`.  We can also suppress row and column names by using `row.names=FALSE` and `col.names=FALSE`.  The `sep=` argument is used to specify a separator (default is a blank space).

## Reading Data from Other Programs

We often need to access data created by a program other than R or to create a data file that can be easily accepted.  The package `foreign` provides functions to read and write in formats supported by a number of different programs.

# Date Objects
A commonly used method for processing dates and time in computer programming is the POSIX standard.  It measures dates and times in seconds since beginning of 1970 in UTC time zone.  In R, `POSIXct` is the R date class for this standard.  The `POSIXlt` class breaks down the date object into year, month, day of the month, hour, minute, and second.  The `POSIXlt` class also calculates day of the week and day of the year (julian day, or ordinal day).  The `Date` class are similar but with dates only (without time).

Typically, dates are entered as characters.  For example, dates are typically entered in the U.S. using numeric values in a format of mm/dd/yyyy (e.g., 5/27/2000) or with month name plus numeric day and year (e.g., December 31 2013). When read into R, the date column becomes a factor variable.  We can use the function `as.Date` to convert the factor variable into dates:

```{r}
first.date <- as.Date("5/27/2000", format="%m/%d/%Y")
second.date <- as.Date("December 31 2003", format="%B %d %Y")
second.date - first.date
```

The first two lines convert two character strings to date class objects.  As date objects are numeric (days since the beginning of 1970), we can use them to calculate days eclipsed between two dates. A more general function for converting date-time object is `strptime`, which converts a date-time character string to a POSIXlt class object, measuring time in seconds since the beginning of 1970.

```{r}
first.d <- strptime("5/27/2000 22:15:00",
                    format="%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S")
second.d <- strptime("December 31, 2003, 4:25:00",
                     format="%B %d, %Y, %H:%M:%S")
second.d - first.d
```

The format of a date object is defined by the POSIX standard, consists of a `%` followed by a single letter:

Date formats in R date-time classes
------------------------------------
Format| Description
------|---------------
`%a`    | Abbreviated weekday name in the current locale on this platform
`%A`    | Full weekday name in the current locale
`%b`    | Abbreviated month name in the current locale on this platform
`%B`    | Full month name in the current locale
`%c`    | Date and time (`%a %b %e %H:%M:%S %Y`)
`%C`    | Century (00-99)
`%d`    | Day of the month as decimal number (01-31)
`%D`    | Date format `%m/%d%y`
`%e`    | Day of the month as decimal number (1-31)
`%F`   | Equivalent to `%Y-%m-%d` (the ISO 8601 date format)
`%G`   | The week-based year as a decimal number
`%h` | Equivalent to `%b`
`%H` | Hours as decimal number (00-23)
`%I` | Hours as decimal number (01-12)
`%j` | Day of year as decimal number (001-366)
`%m` | Month as decimal number (01-12)
`%M` | Minute as decimal number (00-59)
`%n` | Newline on output, arbitrary whitespace on input
`%p` | AM/PM indicator in the locale
`%r` | The 12-hour clock time (using the locale's AM or PM)
`%R` | Equivalent to `%H:%M`
`%S` | Second as decimal number (00-61)
`%t` | Tab on output, arbitrary whitespace on input
`%T` | Equivalent to `H:%M:%S`
`%u` | Weekday as a decimal number (1-7, Monday is 1)
`%U` | Week of the year as decimal number (00-53)
\    |    using Sunday as the first day 1 of the week
`%V` | Week of the year as decimal number (01-53)
\    | as defined in ISO 8601
`%w` | Weekday as decimal number (0-6, Sunday is 0)
`%W` | Week of the year as decimal number (00-53)
\    |   using Monday as the first day of week
`%y` | Year without century (00-99)
`%Y` | Year with century
`%z` | Signed offset in hours and minutes from UTC, 
\    | so -0800 is 8 hours behind UTC


Once a date object is created, we can extract relevant information associated with dates using function `format`. We now create a data frame with a date column:

```{r}
mytime <- data.frame(x = rnorm(100),
                     date=as.Date(round(runif(100)*5000),
                         origin="1970-01-01"))
```
We can add a column of month and a column of week days to the data frame:

```{r}
mytime$Month <- format(mytime$date, "%b")
mytime$weekday <- format(mytime$date, "%a")
```

We can also store date object as a POSIXlt class object, which is a list of nine elements: (1) seconds, (2) minutes, (3) hours, (4) day of month (1-31), (4) month of year (0-11), (5) month of the year (0-11), (6) years since 1900, (7) day of the week (0, Sunday, through 6), (8) day of the year (0-365), and (9) daylight savings indicator. If we want to extract day of the year, month, and year as numeric vectors, we can simply assign the eighth (Julian day), fifth (month), and sixth (year) elements:

```{r}
mydata$Julian <- as.POSIXlt(mydata$Date)[[8]]+1
mydata$Month <- as.POSIXlt(mydata$Date)[[5]]+1
mydata$Year <- as.POSIXlt(mydata$Date)[[6]]+1900
```

In the Maumee River data imported from the USGS site using `read.fwf`,  sampling dates were entered in three columns: `byear`, `bmonth`, and `bday`. To create a column of `dates`, we need to paste these three columns into a date object:
```{r, echo=TRUE}
Maumee.data$Dates <- as.Date(paste(Maumee.data$bmonth, 
                                   Maumee.data$bday, 
                                   Maumee.data$byear, 
                                   sep="/"), 
                             format="%m/%d/%Y")
range(Maumee.data$Dates)
```
